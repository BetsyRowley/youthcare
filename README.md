# YouthCare Front-End Development

Hey y'all, just wanted to get the README.md up and rolling. I hope to use this for basic updates more descriptive than a commit message, yet not quite a novella :)

What's next for y'all?

**June 25, 2017**
I (Betsy) further built out the file structure, adding all views, controllers and factories. Phil and Debbie, your files are under views/templates and are ready to be worked on. I have connected them to the controllers - let me know if you come across any questions.

I also spun up a quick node server so I could render Angular in the browser while we build out the Front-End. I'm not sure where Django plugs in exactly...

**July 9, 2017**
I (Betsy) added UI Bootstrap to add components written in pure AngularJS so we
don't have to diminish the abilities of AngularJS by including jQuery.

I also moved the ng-include for the header to each page rather than the index,
my apologies if I stepped on anyone's toes! Since each page has a varying banner
image and specs, I think it will work better this way with Django...if I'm
understanding that correctly.
